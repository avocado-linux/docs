![i.MX 8M Plus](/img/imx-8m-plus.jpg)

The i.MX 8M Plus Evaluation Kit is a powerful and flexible platform for edge AI development. With a quad-core Cortex-A53 processor and an integrated neural processing unit (NPU), it enables real-time ML inference without overloading the CPU—ideal for vision, voice, and industrial applications.

Combined with Avocado OS, teams can deploy complex workloads quickly using a consistent, production-ready Linux environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Get up and running with the Avocado Linux SDK in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- A Mac (macOS 10.12+) or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 39+) development machine
- Docker installed
- 3GB+ available disk space

### Installing and running the SDK

1. Install the Avocado CLI and append the location of the `avocado` executable to your `PATH` environmant variable.

2. Create your project workspace:

```bash
mkdir avocado-imx8mp
```

3. Initialize a new project:

```bash
cd avocado-imx8mp
avocado init
```

4. Replace `qemux86-64` with `imx8mp-evk` as `target` in `avocado.toml`:

```bash
[runtime.dev]
target = "imx8mp-evk"
```

5. Install all components (SDK, extensions, and runtime dependencies):

```bash
avocado install -f
```
