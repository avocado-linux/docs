Get up and running with the Avocado Linux SDK in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Linux development machine (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 39+)
- Docker installed
- 3GB+ available disk space

## Installing and running the SDK

1. Pull the SDK container:

```bash
docker pull avocadolinux/sdk:apollo-edge
```

2. Create your workspace:

```bash
mkdir avocado-qemu
cd avocado-qemu
```

3. Start the SDK environment:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e \
  AVOCADO_SDK_TARGET=qemux86-64 \
  -v $(pwd):/opt/_avocado/src:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/_avocado:/opt/_avocado:rw \
  --entrypoint entrypoint.sh \
  avocadolinux/sdk:apollo-edge /bin/bash
```

For a list of supported Avocado SDK targets besides `qemux86-64`, return to the [Development Environment page](/guides/development-environment).

Perform all remaining exercises from inside the SDK container.

## Building a system extension

Let's build a system extension that adds peridiod to the runtime.

1. Install package contents for the peridiod package to the sysext sysroot:

```bash
avocado-repo sysext install peridiod -y
```

2. Build system extension:

```bash
avocado-build sysext peridiod
```

3. Verify that a peridiod system extension raw file was output:

```bash
ls -l /opt/_avocado/qemux86-64/extensions/sysext/peridiod.raw
```

## Building a bootable image

1. Download the necessary images for the bootchain and the core rootfs to use when building a complete system image.

```bash
avocado-repo images
```

2. Build var partition containing extension contents:

```bash
avocado-build var
```

3. Build complete system image.

```bash
avocado-build image
```

4. Verify that a complete system image file was output:

```bash
ls -l /opt/_avocado/qemux86-64/output/avocado-image-qemu*.img
```

## Booting an image with QEMU

1. Extend the toolchain with QEMU:

```bash
avocado-repo sdk install nativesdk-qemu
```

2. Run the emulator:

```bash
avocado-run-qemu
```

3. Start the peridiod service from inside the target VM:

```bash
systemctl start peridiod
```
