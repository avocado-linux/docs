title: Welcome to Avocado OS
description: A modern, composable embedded Linux distribution built for rapid development and production-ready deployment.
---

**Avocado OS** is a next-generation embedded Linux distribution that bridges the gap between rapid development and production-grade stability. Built and maintained by [Peridio](https://www.peridio.com/), Avocado OS rethinks how Linux systems are built, deployed, and maintained in modern products.

Whether you're prototyping on a dev board or deploying to thousands of devices in the field, Avocado helps you move fast **without compromising on reliability, security, or maintainability.**

Avocado OS is 100% open source. It's built to stand alone ‚Äî and scales even further when paired with Peridio Fleet.

## What Makes Avocado OS Different?

### üß© Composable by Design
Instead of traditional monolithic builds, Avocado uses a **layered architecture**. Developers assemble systems using a small, immutable base and extend it with modular **system extensions**, **configuration overlays**, and **portable services**. This makes it simple to develop, test, and deploy without managing partitions or modifying core images.

This approach provides **faster development** by letting you build and test individual components independently, **simplified deployment** through layer updates without full system rebuilds, and **reduced complexity** by eliminating partition management or core image modifications.

### üîê Security-First Approach
Avocado has comprehensive security features planned and in development:

- **Secure Boot**: Cryptographic verification of the boot chain
- **Root Filesystem Integrity**: dm-verity protection against tampering
- **Full-Disk Encryption**: LUKS-based encryption for data protection
- **Device Attestation**: Cryptographic identity for remote verification

These tools ensure that only verified software runs on your devices‚Äîfrom bootloader to user space.

### üõ† Built with Yocto, Built to Scale
Avocado is fully based on the **Yocto Project**, making it highly customizable for your hardware while maintaining consistency across platforms. Whether you're targeting a single-board computer or a production SoC, Avocado provides a clean path from development to deployment using industry-standard embedded Linux toolchain.

### üå± Developer Experience Matters
With prebuilt layers, sensible defaults, and a vibrant extension ecosystem, Avocado takes the friction out of embedded Linux development. Developers can focus on building features‚Äînot wrestling with build systems.
