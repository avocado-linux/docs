# Welcome to Avocado OS

**Avocado OS** is a next-generation embedded Linux distribution that bridges the gap between rapid development and production-grade security. Built by embedded developers for embedded developers, Avocado rethinks how Linux systems are built, deployed, and maintained in modern products.

Whether you're prototyping on a dev board or shipping to thousands of devices in the field, Avocado helps you move fast **without compromising on reliability, security, or maintainability**.

## What Makes Avocado OS Different?

### üß© Composable by Design
Instead of traditional monolithic builds, Avocado uses a **layered architecture**. Developers assemble systems using a small, immutable base and extend it with modular **system extensions**, **configuration overlays**, and **portable services**. This makes it simple to develop, test, and deploy without managing partitions or modifying core images.

### üîê A Roadmap for Security
Avocado has plans for:
- Secure Boot
- dm-verity for root filesystem integrity
- Full-disk encryption with LUKS
- Cryptographic identity for attestation and remote verification

These tools ensure that only verified software runs on your devices‚Äîfrom bootloader to user space.

### üõ† Built with Yocto, Built to Scale
Avocado is fully based on the **Yocto Project**, making it highly customizable for your hardware while maintaining consistency across platforms. Whether you're targeting a single-board computer or a production SoC, Avocado provides a clean path from development to deployment.

### üå± Developer Experience Matters
With prebuilt layers, sensible defaults, and a vibrant extension ecosystem, Avocado takes the friction out of embedded Linux development. Developers can focus on building features‚Äînot wrestling with build systems.
